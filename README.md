# MiniGolfGame
## Description
This project is a simple mini golf game created using the LibGDX Java framework. It allows users to play through several holes of mini golf, keeping track of their scores as they play. The game implements realistic physics including friction to slow down the ball as it rolls and collision detection to handle the ball bouncing of walls.
